# Hoff_Model_in_R
This project implements a Hoff Variance Envelope model for analyzing and visualizing time-varying principal components (PCs) of climate or temporal datasets. The envelopes are constructed based on fitted variance components (C, D, E) and are used to understand how the variability in each PC evolves over time.
